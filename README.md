Google Cloud Function triggered by Pub/Sub message being sent on certain topic.

This function is simple example of cloud function with Pub/Sub trigger type which send message to Slack channel on behalf of the user(Bot). User will be defined by user token from Slack. 

We will use test slack channel `test-webshop-cf` to test how this function works.

Runtime: Node.js

### Guidebook to run this function
1. Clone this repo
```
git clone git@github.com:lemon57/cloud-function-pubsub-slack-msg.git
```
2. Define Slack user `SLACK_TOKEN` and `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` in .env file. 
You can find user `SLACK_TOKEN` -> [Slack user toke](https://api.slack.com/apps/A03FHHA7URG/oauth?).
And `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` you will find in description of the channel in Slack.
3. Deploy this function to GC. Wait a few min â˜•
```
gcloud functions deploy <CF_NAME> <TRIGGER_TYPE> --region=<REGION_NAME> --runtime=<CF_RUNTIME>
```
4. Check that the function deployed successfully: by command or through GCC UI.
```
gcloud functions describe <CF_NAME> --region=<REGION_NAME>
```
5. Invoke function directly by command:
```
gcloud functions call <CF_NAME> --data '{"data":"R29vZ2xlIGNsb3VkIGZ1bmN0aW9uIHdvcmtzaG9w"}'
```
This string `R29vZ2xlIGNsb3VkIGZ1bmN0aW9uIHdvcmtzaG9w` base64 encoded. To use your specific message and make it base64 encoded you can use this resource [base64encode](https://www.base64encode.org/)

or by sending message to certain topic by command:
```
gcloud pubsub topics publish projects/<PROJECT_NAME>/topics/<TOPIC_NAME> --message Hello
```
Replace `PROJECT_NAME` by our current boozt project name.
Replace `TOPIC_NAME` by topic name which you find by following command:
```
gcloud pubsub topics list | grep workshop
```
The topic for this workshop is predefined.

6. Check the logs:
```
gcloud functions logs read --execution-id=<EXECUTION-ID> --region=<REGION_NAME>
```
Take `EXECUTION_ID` from the output after executing these commands: `gcloud functions call` or `gcloud pubsub topics publish`.

6. Check slack channel `test-webshop-cf`
